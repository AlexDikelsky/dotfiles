My dotfiles

The most updated stuff is usually on the `chromebook-ubuntu` branch. The most important mappings for vim
are in the "Large keymap changes" section, although the insert line commands (`nnoremap [<space> O<esc>j`) are
very useful as well. My .bashrc and .zshrcs are both have modified versions of `^L`. They both list current
directories in addition to clearing the screen.
